## About eAPI

eAPI uses JSON-RPC over HTTP.  

Using eAPI, an application can send a list of EOS commands (both show commands and configuration commands) to EOS devices.  
The devices reply using a JSON representation of the show commands which make devices states programmatic audit easy.  

## About this repository 

This repo has examples of Arista EOS automation using eAPI.  
This includes devices configuration and devices states audit.  
We will also see how eAPI can use text files (generated from templates) to configure and audit devices instead of using hardcoded python lists of commands.  

## Requirements 

### Requirements on the EOS devices

```
s7152#show running-config section management api
management api http-commands
   protocol http
   no shutdown
s7152#
```

### Requirements on your laptop 

```
python -V
Python 3.7.7
```
```
pip install jsonrpclib-pelix 
```
```
pip freeze | grep jsonrpc
jsonrpclib-pelix==0.4.1
```

## Repository structure 

- The inventory file is [inventory.yml](inventory.yml)
- The variables are defined in the [host_vars](host_vars) directory 
- The directory [templates](templates) has the templates
  - [config.j2](templates/config.j2) is a template to generate EOS configuration files
  - [bgp_audit.j2](templates/bgp_audit.j2) is a template to generate the EOS show commands to validate the desired states on EOS devices. 
- The directory [config](config) has the devices configuration files generated from the template [config.j2](templates/config.j2) and the variables in [host_vars](host_vars) directory. we use eAPI to configure the devices.   
- The directory [audit](audit) has the EOS show commands generated from the template [audit.j2](templates/bgp_audit.j2) and the variables in the [host_vars](host_vars) directory. We reuse the same variables we used to generate the configuration files. To get the devices states, we use eAPI to run these show commands and parse the output. 
- The file [configure_network.py](configure_network.py) generates EOS configuration files from the template [config.j2](templates/config.j2), converts the generated configuration files into lists of configuration commands, and uses eAPI to configure the devices using these lists of configuration commands.
- The file [audit_all_states.py](audit_all_states.py) audits **all** the configured BGP neigbhors. It uses the devices configuration as a SoT. 
- The file [audit_desired_states.py](audit_desired_states.py) audits **only** the BGP neighbors you configured (the ones described in the variables in the [host_vars](host_vars) directory). It uses the devices variables as a SoT instead of using the devices configuration as a SoT. To audit only the BGP neighbors you configured, it generates EOS show commands from the template [bgp_audit.j2](templates/bgp_audit.j2) and the variables in the [host_vars](host_vars) directory, and save these show commands in the directory [audit](audit). Then it converts the generated text files into lists of show commands, and uses eAPI to audit these BGP neighbors. So to audit only the BGP neighbors you configured, we reuse the same variables we used to generate the configuration files.
- The file [generate_audit_report.py](generate_audit_report.py) audits the devices states and generates a report (file [report.txt](report.txt)). It uses the devices variables to audit the devices states.   
- The file [report.txt](report.txt) is an audit report generated by the script [generate_audit_report.py](generate_audit_report.py)
- The file [commands.txt](commands.txt) is used for the basic [basic eAPI tutorial](#basic-eapi-tutorial) 

## Basic eAPI tutorial 

We will use a Python interactive session for this tutorial  

```
>>> from jsonrpclib import Server
>>> from pprint import pprint as pp
>>> username = "arista"
>>> password = "arista"
>>> ip = "10.83.28.203"
>>> url = "http://" + username + ":" + password + "@" + ip + "/command-api"
>>> print(url)
http://arista:arista@10.83.28.203/command-api
>>> switch = Server(url)
```

### The `runCmds` method

Using the `runCmds` method, an application can send a list of EOS commands (both show commands and configuration commands) to EOS devices.  

#### Running a show command

```
>>> result=switch.runCmds(version=1,cmds=["show version"])
>>> pp(result)
[{'architecture': 'i686',
  'bootupTimestamp': 1589457836.0,
  'hardwareRevision': '00.00',
  'internalBuildId': '523a3357-484c-4110-9019-39750ffa8af5',
  'internalVersion': '4.22.4M-2GB-15583082.4224M',
  'isIntlVersion': False,
  'memFree': 2839848,
  'memTotal': 4009188,
  'mfgName': 'Arista',
  'modelName': 'DCS-7150S-52-CL-F',
  'serialNumber': 'JPE12370337',
  'systemMacAddress': '00:1c:73:1e:e5:ee',
  'uptime': 33731.23,
  'version': '4.22.4M-2GB'}]
>>> 
>>> result[0]['modelName']
'DCS-7150S-52-CL-F'
>>> result[0]['version']
'4.22.4M-2GB'
>>> 
```

#### Running a show command using auto completion

```
>>> result=switch.runCmds(version=1,cmds=["sh ver"], format='json', autoComplete=True)
>>> result[0]['modelName']
'DCS-7150S-52-CL-F'
>>> result[0]['version']
'4.22.4M-2GB'
>>> 
```

#### Running a list of several show commands

```
>>> commands_list = ["sh env temp", "sh ver"]
>>> result=switch.runCmds(version=1,cmds=commands_list, format='json', autoComplete=True)
>>> result[0]['systemStatus'] 
'temperatureOk'
>>> result[1]['version'] 
'4.22.4M-2GB'
>>> 
```

#### Configuring EOS with a list of several commands

```
>>> conf = ["enable", "configure", "vlan 10", "name ten"]
>>> conf_vlan_10 = switch.runCmds(version=1,cmds=conf)
>>> result=switch.runCmds(version=1,cmds=["show vlan"])
>>> result[0]['vlans']['10']['name']
'ten'
>>> 
```
```
>>> conf = ["enable", "configure", "vlan 20", "name twenty", "vlan 30", "name thirty"] 
>>> conf_vlans = switch.runCmds(version=1,cmds=conf)
>>> result=switch.runCmds(version=1,cmds=["show vlan"], format='json')
>>> for key,value in result[0]['vlans'].items(): 
...    print("vlan " + key + " name is " + value['name'])
... 
vlan 1 name is default
vlan 10 name is ten
vlan 20 name is twenty
vlan 30 name is thirty
>>> 
```

#### Configuring EOS using auto completion 

```
>>> conf = ["enable", "conf", "vla 40", "nam forty"] 
>>> conf_vlan_101 = switch.runCmds(version=1,cmds=conf, autoComplete=True)
>>> result=switch.runCmds(version=1,cmds=["sh vla"], format='json', autoComplete=True)
>>> result[0]['vlans']['40']['name']
'forty'
>>> 
```

#### Configuring EOS devices using a file 

We will create a list of commands from the file [commands.txt](commands.txt).  
Then we will use eAPI to run these commands.  
 
```
>>> f = open("commands.txt", "r")
>>> conf = f.read().splitlines()
>>> f.close() 
>>> conf
['enable', 'conf', 'vlan 50', 'name fifty', 'vlan 60 ', 'name sixty']
>>> 
>>> conf_vlans = switch.runCmds(version=1,cmds=conf, autoComplete=True)
>>> result=switch.runCmds(version=1,cmds=["sh vlan"], format='json', autoComplete=True)
>>> for key,value in result[0]['vlans'].items(): 
...    print("vlan " + key + " name is " + value['name'])
... 
vlan 1 name is default
vlan 10 name is ten
vlan 60 name is sixty
vlan 20 name is twenty
vlan 30 name is thirty
vlan 50 name is fifty
vlan 40 name is forty
>>> 
```

### The `getCommandCompletions` method

The `getCommandCompletions` method can be used to complete a command.  
This section is fyi only. Use only `runCmds` method. The `runCmds` method supports auto completion as shown above.  

```
>>> command_to_complete = "sh"
>>> command_completed = switch.getCommandCompletions(command_to_complete) 
>>> 
>>> command_completed
{'complete': False, 'completions': {'show': 'Display details of switch operation'}, 'errors': {}}
>>> 
>>> command_completed['completions']
{'show': 'Display details of switch operation'}
>>> 
>>> print(command_completed['completions'].keys())
dict_keys(['show'])
>>> 
>>> for item in command_completed['completions']: 
...     print(item)
... 
show
>>> 
>>> for key,value in command_completed['completions'].items(): 
...      print(key)
... 
show
>>> 
```
```
>>> command_to_complete = "sh ver"
>>> command_completed=switch.getCommandCompletions(command_to_complete) 
>>> command_completed['completions']
{'version': 'Software and hardware versions'}
>>> 
```

## eAPI advanced demo

### Lab topology

3 EOS devices connected in a triangle topology.  
We will use eAPI to configure the devices (EBGP and interfaces) and to audit them.  

![topology.png](topology.png)

### Configure the devices

The file [configure_network.py](configure_network.py) generates EOS configuration files from the template [config.j2](templates/config.j2), converts the generated configuration files into lists of configuration commands, and uses eAPI to configure the devices using these lists of configuration commands.

```
python configure_network.py
```

### Audit the devices 

#### Audit all BGP sessions currently configured on the devices

The file [audit_all_states.py](audit_all_states.py) audits **all** the configured BGP neigbhors. It uses the devices configuration as a SoT. 

```
python audit_all_states.py
```

Script output:

Auditing all BGP neighbors configured on the device switch1
i.e we are currently using the device configuration as a SoT
the BGP session with 10.10.10.1 is Established
the number of IPv4 prefixes sent to the BGP neighbor 10.10.10.1 is 7
the number of IPv4 prefixes received from the BGP neighbor 10.10.10.1 is 5
the BGP session with 10.10.10.3 is Established
the number of IPv4 prefixes sent to the BGP neighbor 10.10.10.3 is 6
the number of IPv4 prefixes received from the BGP neighbor 10.10.10.3 is 5
------------------------------------------------------------
Auditing all BGP neighbors configured on the device switch2
i.e we are currently using the device configuration as a SoT
the BGP session with 10.10.10.0 is Established
the number of IPv4 prefixes sent to the BGP neighbor 10.10.10.0 is 5
the number of IPv4 prefixes received from the BGP neighbor 10.10.10.0 is 5
the BGP session with 10.10.10.5 is Established
the number of IPv4 prefixes sent to the BGP neighbor 10.10.10.5 is 6
the number of IPv4 prefixes received from the BGP neighbor 10.10.10.5 is 6
------------------------------------------------------------

the number of IPv4 prefixes sent to the BGP neighbor 10.10.10.2 is 5
the number of IPv4 prefixes received from the BGP neighbor 10.10.10.2 is 6
the BGP session with 10.10.10.4 is Established
the number of IPv4 prefixes sent to the BGP neighbor 10.10.10.4 is 6
the number of IPv4 prefixes received from the BGP neighbor 10.10.10.4 is 6
```
#### Audit only the BGP sessions you configured 

The file [audit_desired_states.py](audit_desired_states.py) audits **only** the BGP neighbors you configured (the ones described in the variables in the [host_vars](host_vars) directory). It uses the devices variables as a SoT instead of using the devices configuration as a SoT. To audit only the BGP neighbors you configured, it generates EOS show commands from the template [bgp_audit.j2](templates/bgp_audit.j2) and the variables in the [host_vars](host_vars) directory, and save these show commands in the directory [audit](audit). Then it converts the generated text files into lists of show commands, and uses eAPI to audit these BGP neighbors. So to audit only the BGP neighbors you configured, we reuse the same variables we used to generate the configuration files.

```
python audit_desired_states.py
```

```
To see the commands generated in the [audit](audit) directory, run this command: 
```
ls audit   
```

#### Generate an audit report

The file [generate_audit_report.py](generate_audit_report.py) audits the devices states and generates a report (file [report.txt](report.txt)). It uses the devices variables to audit the devices states.   

```
python generate_audit_report.py
```
Script output: 
```
Auditing switch1
Auditing switch2
Auditing switch3
All tests done. The audit report is available in the file report.txt
```
To read the report (file [report.txt](report.txt)), run this command: 
```
more report.txt
```
